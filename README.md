# Hi, Matthew here!

Front-end engineer for [OK Systems](https://okgrade.com/) with a passion for creating beautiful user experiences. Because who doesn't want that?

I also run a web / app dev digital agency on the side, ðŸ‡¨ [Coded Creative](https://www.thecodedcreative.com/) ðŸ‡¨.

When I'm not coding or running the sidebiz, you can find working out in the gym, playing basketball / flag football, playing piano, watching NBA games (hoping my fantasy players perform well) or watching YouTube mini-documentaries to keep up with the happenings of the world (because just watching the news is plain boring).
